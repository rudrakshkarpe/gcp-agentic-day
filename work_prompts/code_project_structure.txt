Structure for projects that I want to create for a project is an application.


Here is the project structure that I want to create for the application:

Project Directory Structure
The backend for "Project Kisan" will be built using FastAPI, following a modular and scalable project structure that promotes maintainability and future expansion.

Description of Project Structure and Files
Each component of the project structure serves a distinct purpose, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.

project-kisan-backend/: The root directory for the entire backend project.

app/: Contains the core source code for the FastAPI application.

main.py: The main entry point of the application. It initializes the FastAPI instance and includes the API routers.

app/api/: This package houses all API-related modules.

v1/: Encapsulates version 1 of the API, allowing for future versioning without disrupting existing clients.

endpoints/: Contains the modules that define the API endpoints for each feature.

crop_diagnosis.py, market_analysis.py, government_schemes.py: These files define the routes and logic for their respective features.

schemas/: Holds the Pydantic models used for data validation and serialization of request and response bodies.

crop_diagnosis.py, market_analysis.py, government_schemes.py: These files define the data schemas for their corresponding features.

app/core/: This package includes core application logic and configuration.

config.py: Manages application settings, such as API keys and database connections, loaded from environment variables.

security.py: Handles security-related functions, such as API key validation or JWT authentication.

app/services/: This package contains the business logic, isolating it from the API layer.

voice_service.py: Interacts with voice processing services for speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities.

diagnosis_service.py: Communicates with the AI models for crop disease diagnosis.

market_data_service.py: Fetches and analyzes data from external market APIs.

scheme_info_service.py: Retrieves and processes information about government schemes.

requirements.txt: A list of all Python dependencies for the project.

.env: A file to store environment variables, such as API keys and other sensitive configuration. This file should be included in .gitignore to prevent it from being committed to version control.

Your Task:

Understand the project structure, what the purpose of each of the directories and sub directories and the files contained in them is, and then create the entire project structure for the application that I want to create.
- Focus only on the endpoints and the main services that they would expose to the front end application
- Also generate the first draft for the code in the major modules, as per python best practices and conventions, so that the project is structured in a way that it can be easily understood by other developers and can be easily maintained in the long run.

Create the project structure within the already created project-kisan-backend directory.
