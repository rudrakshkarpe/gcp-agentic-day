Here is the problem statement:

Problem Statement
The Challenge: Rohan, a young farmer in a village in rural Karnataka, inspects his tomato crop. A strange pattern of yellow spots has appeared on the leaves of several plants. Is it a fungus? A pest? The wrong kind of fertilizer? The local agricultural office is miles away, and by the time he gets an answer, a significant portion of his crop could be lost. He also faces another challenge: when to sell. The price he gets for his produce at the local mandi can vary wildly from day to day. A day's delay could mean the difference between a profitable season and a loss. He has a smartphone, but the information he needs—expert pest diagnosis, real-time market prices, and guidance on government subsidies—is scattered, complex, and not available in his native Kannada. He doesn't need more data; he needs an ally, an expert in his pocket who understands his land and his language.

The Objective: Build "Project Kisan," an AI-powered personal assistant that acts as a personal agronomist, market analyst, and government scheme navigator for small-scale farmers. This agent should provide actionable intelligence to farmers, enabling them to protect their crops, maximize their income, and navigate complex agricultural systems. The agent should:

Diagnose Crop Diseases Instantly: Allow a farmer to take a photo of a diseased plant. The agent will use a multimodal Gemini model on Vertex AI to instantly analyze the image, identify the pest or disease, and provide clear, actionable advice on locally available and affordable remedies.

Deliver Real-Time Market Analysis: Enable a farmer to ask in their native language, "What is the price of tomatoes today?" The agent, built with Vertex AI Agent Builder, will fetch real-time data from public market APIs, use a Gemini model to analyze trends, and provide a simple, actionable summary to guide selling decisions.

Navigate Government Schemes: When a farmer asks about a specific need, like "subsidies for drip irrigation," the agent will use a Gemini model trained on government agricultural websites to explain relevant schemes in simple terms, list eligibility requirements, and provide direct links to application portals.

Enable Voice-First Interaction: Overcome literacy barriers by allowing farmers to interact entirely through voice. The agent will use Vertex AI Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech to understand queries in local dialects and respond with clear, easy-to-understand voice notes.

Tech Stack: Use of Google AI technologies is mandatory.



Here is the Solution:
solving them. 

## Overall Description of the Solution
The Project Kisan would be an application that would be tailored to a farmer's need, offering the capability of being interacted and navigated completely through voice mode in their native language Kannada.
This would elevate the accessibility of this application in the following ways:

- Break the Barrier of Literacy: The application would be completely voice-first, allowing farmers to interact with the system without needing to read or write. This is crucial in rural areas where literacy rates may be low. The interface would be designed in a voice first hand pictorial visual manner which would allow the farmers to not be very tech savvy and allow them to use it easily for their use cases.

- Usage in Minimal Clicks: The application would be designed to keep minimize the number of clicks required to perform any action. This would ensure that farmers can quickly access the information they need, even when they are in the field.

- Personalized & Localized Experience: The application would take into account factors. Describing, providing. Necessary information about the user and his current situation and circumstances. Including the location, the crop, uh. Details the soil, information about the soil and other relevant detail data points which would play a key role in providing personalized and localized solutions and recommendations to the farmers. This would materialize in the form of the plant disease diagnosis (in terms of what diseases are the most prevalent and what all factors are prevalent considering farmer's context and subsequently coming up with solutions which are practically executable for them), government schemes recommendations (taking into accoun the eligibility, limits, etc. of the scheme and how the farmer fits into them and keeping track of past benefits availed) and price recommendations (based on the location and prevailing prices for the season). 


## Detailed Description of the User Interaction with the application
- The application would offer a very easy to reach microphone button on the very home screen of the application on which the farmer can click and start speaking in their native language Kannada. The application would then transcribe the audio to text and process it to understand the intent of the query.

- The application, understanding the intent of the query, would be able to navigate to the appropriate. module of the application and continue with the workflow of that partciular module, while keeping the converstaion history tracked in the background as a chat interface (accessible by the User at any point, similar to the way past conversations with ChatGPT or Other LLM Providers are accessible), meanwhile proceeding with the Voice Mode Interaction with the user.

- The application would be providing all the answers in the preferred language of the user, which is Kannada in this case. The application would be able to understand the local dialects and nuances of the language, ensuring that the communication is clear and effective.

- The application would be able to provide personalized and localized solutions based on the user's context, such as their location, crop type, soil conditions, and other relevant factors. This would ensure that the recommendations are practical and actionable for the farmer.

## Delving into the Modules of the Application

### 1. Crop Disease Diagnosis
- The farmer can take a photo of a diseased plant using their smartphone camera.
- The application would then prompt the user to provide information about the crop, which would help in diagnosing any problem or disease with the plant. The fixed set of questions, needed in every case would be posed to the user as per their preferred mode. It could be through a Form Interface, a Conversational Text Chat, or in a conversational manner in voice mode, ensuring that the user feels comfortable and engaged.
- Along with the set fields which are to be fetched and asked from the user, in every case the. Application would also based on the analysis of the image and the provided information. Identify and determine whether it needs to task any further questions related to the diagnosis of the plant disease. To perceive answers to all such questions, the application would continue with an ongoing voice interactive dialog with the farmer until it has obtained all the necessary information it needs to perform a diagnosis and come up with the solutions. 
- Next, the application would use a multimodal Gemini model on Vertex AI to analyze the image and the provided information, identify the pest or disease, and provide clear, actionable advice on locally available and affordable remedies.
- The application would also provide information on the most prevalent diseases in the area, based on the user's location and the crop type. This would help the farmer understand the context of the problem and take preventive measures in the future.

### 2. Real-Time Market Analysis
- The farmer can ask the application about the current market price of their produce, such as tomatoes, in their native language Kannada.
- The application would fetch real-time data from public market APIs and use a Gemini model to analyze trends and provide a simple, actionable summary to guide selling decisions.
- The application would also provide information on the best time to sell based on historical data and current market trends, helping the farmer maximize their income.
- Additionally, the application would provide insights into local market conditions, such as demand and supply, which would help the farmer make informed decisions about when and where to sell their produce.
- The application would be, in the backend caching such data and information, so that the farmer can access it even when they are offline or in areas with poor internet connectivity.

### 3. Government Schemes Navigation
- The farmer can ask the application about specific government schemes related to agriculture, such as subsidies for drip irrigation, in their native language Kannada.
- The application would use a Gemini model trained on government agricultural websites to explain relevant schemes in simple terms, list eligibility requirements, and provide direct links to application portals.
- The application would also keep track of the farmer's past benefits availed and provide reminders for upcoming deadlines or new schemes that may be relevant to them.
- The application would provide personalized recommendations based on the farmer's profile, such as their crop type, location, and eligibility for various schemes.
- The application would also provide information on how to apply for these schemes, including the necessary documentation and steps involved, making it easier for the farmer to navigate the complex agricultural systems.
